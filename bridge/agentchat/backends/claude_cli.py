"""Claude Code CLI model backend.

Uses the `claude` CLI tool via subprocess — no extra Python dependencies.
Useful when Claude Code is installed locally and you want the bridge to
leverage its tool-use capabilities.

When an ``on_progress`` callback is provided, the CLI is invoked with
``--output-format stream-json --include-partial-messages`` so that
intermediate events *and* token-by-token partial text deltas are emitted
line-by-line and forwarded to the caller for real-time streaming.

Performance flags applied to every invocation:
  --no-session-persistence   Don't write session files to disk

Optional flags (constructor kwargs or env vars):
  --effort <level>           low/medium/high/max — controls reasoning depth
  --max-turns <n>            Cap agentic turns (print mode safety rail)
  --fallback-model <model>   Auto-fallback when primary model is overloaded
  --chrome                   Enable Chrome browser integration for web tasks

        When MCP context is set (resolved_tools via set_mcp_context), Claude CLI
        handles tool calls natively via the MCP server — single invocation, no
        iterative XML parsing loop. In that mode the CLI owns the loop, so intra-
        turn guardrails cannot be enforced here; the server instead injects a
        "don't repeat failing/no-progress calls" directive into the system prompt.

        Falls back to the legacy <tool_call> XML loop when MCP is not available;
        guardrails ARE enforced on that path.
